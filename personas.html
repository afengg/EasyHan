	<div><p>John is a high school Korean language student who is highly motivated to learn Korean, and has the passion to extend his Korean studies outside of school. At the recommendation of his teacher, he picked up EasyHan as a way to achieve his goals.</p>

	<p>As a student trying to learn a foreign language, he found that EasyHan was not a barebones program that left him with no direction or guidance. EasyHan provided him with vocabulary words suited to him as a student, 
	and made sure he did not get overwhelmed by the difficulty of learning a new language by slowly expanding the vocabulary pool.</p>

	<p>At the same time, John is an individual that is capable of honest self-assessment and does not treat EasyHan as a chore or an assignment. This helps the program accurately judge John’s progress and adjust accordingly. </p>

	<div class="well"><p>“Students who have the drive for extra-curricular learning need to be able to do so without being overwhelmed.”</p></div>
		<div>
			<p>Jane is a Korean language teacher who recommends EasyHan to students who have sought her advice on extra opportunities to practice their Korean. 
			The main features of EasyHan that appeals to Jane is that it utilizes a spaced repetition system that helps user recall words just before they are about to forget them. 
			Especially problematic words will appear more often, while the ones that are committed to memory will appear less often. This helps the user make the most of their time.</p>

			<p>Jane especially likes the pronunciation recording feature, which provides a small boost in the hardest part of a language: speaking it. 
				The typing practice also appeals to Jane, who recognizes the benefits of learning how to type in Korean.</p>
